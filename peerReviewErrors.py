Note from student:

I have corrected anywhere from 5 to 20 errors depending how to count them:
    - 4 or 6 for syntax depending whether to count multiple per line
    - 1 for spelling
    - 0 or 2 for pylint suggestion R1714: `A==B & A==C` -> `A in (B, C)`.
    - 0 or 2 for stylistic suggestions: consistent single-quotes.
    - 0 or 1 for design - unexpected cave input (adds if-statement).
    - 0 or 1 for design - unexpected playAgain input (adds while-loop).
    - 0 or 2 for style - replacing empty print statements with '\n\r' in previous print statements
    - 0 or 1 for design - accepting 'n' as 'no' for user input
    - 0 or 4 for pylint suggestions C0114/C0116: module & function docstrings
I have left the following unsolved:
    - pylint error C0103 (invalid-name) - ____ not snake_case: 6 counts
    - pylint error C0103 (invalid-name) - ____ not UPPER_CASE: 4 counts
    - pylint error W0104 (pointless-string-statement) - this note.

Which corrections are in scope of the assignment? Am I missing any?
